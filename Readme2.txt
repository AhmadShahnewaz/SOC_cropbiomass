# Data Files: 
weather_all_sites_all_years.csv  => Contains weather data for different sites and years.

# R Scripts
function_crop.R			 => contains the function of maize crop growth
Proj_1a.R			 => contains the functions, parameters and execution of crop model and plots
Proj_1b.R			 => function, parameters, execution and plot of SOC model
Proj_2a.R			 => function, parameters, execution and plot of SOC uncertainty and sensitivity model
Proj_2a.R			 => impact of SOC to increased temperature model



# It is suggested before execution the codes 
to save all files in one folder say Proj_folder
to change the directory in R script setwd(".../Proj_folder") according to the files saved
to load any required package like ggplot2 if necessary
